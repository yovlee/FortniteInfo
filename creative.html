		<p>Fortnite added creative mode to Fortnite to make the game a have a imaginative aspect when playing it. It is also made 
		for the community to share games or maps they have made and have other people play them. It allows people to go into a pre-made
		smaller world. It has a menu with lists of object and pre-made buildings to choose from. You can also create something and then 
		customize battle settings and fight your friends. It is basically like a simple form of Minecraft. Epic Games made it at the time
		to hook Minecraft players into playing their game with something they like doing. In the mode you have a phone that you can change
		the size of objects with and copy or delete, and a lot more. Fortntie features new map that creators have made and wanted people to play. 
		Sometimes for fun, or for a competition to get into a certain tournament. Different ones are changed out by about two weeks unless it is 
		played a lot or for a tournament. Most of the items and weapons that have been vaulted are also available in creative. The downside to creative
		is that there is a certain amount of space for someone to add stuff to the islands. People can also submit there creative maps to Epic Games to be
		a location on the map in the real game for two weeks. With loot made by Epic Games.
