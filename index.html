		<h2 class="column1">Other Battle Royales</h2>
		<p class="column2">Fortnite is not the only battle royale game out there. Another famously known battle royale game is, PUBG. PUBG is mainly different to Fortnite in the 
		way that it is realistic rather than animated and cartoon-ish, like Fortnite. Most of the shooting mechanics in the game are similar in both of them. Another well known 
		battle royale game that is fairly knew, Apex Legends. The main difference between Apex Legends and Fortnite is that Apex is in first person. that 
		means you see the game through the characters eyes. In Fortnite, you are in thrid person. That means that you see the game like your a camera behind the person. The most 
		unique thing about Fortnite, and why people would prefer it, is that you can build in the game. That way, rather than hiding behind natural cover, you can destroy natural cover and make your own man-made cover.</p>

		<h2 class="column3">The Beginning</h2>
		<p class="column4">In the beginning of Fortnite, it was very different how it is now. For example, there was less locations to land at when you started the game. There was only Pleasent Park, Anarchy Acres, Wailing Woods, Tomato 
		Town, Lonely Lodge, Flush Factory, Greasy Grove, Loot Lake, Moisty Mire, Dusty Depot, Fatal Fields, and Salty Springs. Out of those locations a lot of them were actually taken out of the game. Those include Anarchy Acres, Wailing 
		Woods, Tomato Town, Moisty Mire, Dusty Depot, Flush Factory, and Greasy Grove. There was also some designs for the guns in your inventory that they changed. For example, the grenade looks like an actual grenade now. Another thing was
		that Fortnite gameplay was more quiet and based on exploring and looking for guns. As it grew Fortnite became more popular and more people started playing it. That made the point of the game more on fighting. That is why Fortnite gradually
		made more guns and locations to land at and get more guns to fight all over the map. In old Fortnite, people were also pretty bad at the game. Now people are good at the game and people get in more intense and complicated battles.
