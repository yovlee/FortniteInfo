		<p>Fortnite has new events coming every month-ish. That is to transition to a new season. Some of them have been, Kevin the Cube, the Volcano, 
		The Meteor Shower, and the Loot Lake Event. They are also to keep the game new and interesting. For example the volcano event allowed season 9
		to start. Season 9 was modern. old location were turned into to locations and different gun skins, skins, gliders, and emotes were made to be
		more modern like for a short amount of time. The current season is 9. And the current event that is happening right now is the monster under Polar
		Peak. PoLar Peak's largest building collapsed because the monster broke out of the ice and went somewhere else. Some people suspect that that monster
		will be related to season 10. All the events have been live during a certain period of time while people are playing the game and people can watch the 
		event happen. The unvaulting event that opened loot lake was controlled by people playing at the same time and working together. There was three beams 
		pointing at different places and three people had to point the beams at loot lake and keep them there at the same time. Unfortunately, the people pointing
		the beams were not immune to damage, and people could kill them at the time when they were trying to point the beams.
