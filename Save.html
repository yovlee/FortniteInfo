		<p>Fortnite: Save the World is a co-op third-person shooter survival video game developed and published by Epic
		Games. The game was released as a paid-for early access title for Microsoft Windows, macOS, PlayStation 4 and Xbox
		One on July 25, 2017, with a full free-to-play release expected sometime in 2019. The retail versions of the game were
		published by Gearbox Software, while online distribution of the PC versions is handled by Epic's launcher. Fortnite is 
		set in contemporary Earth, where the sudden appearance of a worldwide storm causes 98% of the world's population to disappear, 
		and zombie-like creatures rise to attack the remainder. Considered by Epic as a cross between Minecraft and Left 4 Dead, Fortnite
		has up to four players cooperating on various missions on randomly-generated maps to collect resources, build fortifications around
		defensive objectives that are meant to help fight the storm and protect survivors, and construct weapons and traps to engage in combat
		with waves of these creatures that attempt to destroy the objectives. Players gain rewards through these missions to improve their hero
		characters, support teams, and arsenal of weapon and trap schematics to be able to take on more difficult missions. The game is supported 
		through microtransactions to purchase in-game currency that can be used towards these upgrades. A standalone battle royale game version, 
		Fortnite Battle Royale, was released for the same platforms in September 2017. Following the release, the player-versus-environment mode
		was officially distinguished as "Save the World". In the meta-game, the player has an inventory of weapon and trap schematics, hero characters,
		defender characters, and support characters, along with collected resources. Schematics are used to construct weapons and traps when on the field. 
		Hero characters represent characters from one of four classes that the player can use while on a mission, as well as used to undertake resource-gathering 
		missions making them unavailable to use until they return from the mission. Defender characters can be summoned to help with defense but only if there are
		less than four players on a mission. Support characters are used to form various non-playable squads that provide passive bonuses to the player's attack
		strength, building speed, armor, and health, with additional benefits if the player can match certain characterization attributes within a squad.
		The player can spend different types of experience points and resources earned as mission rewards, from loot boxes (represented as llama 
		pinatas), or other sources to level up and evolve schematics and characters. For weapons and traps, this generally boosts their effectiveness
		as well as unlocking additional attribute bonuses, while leveling up hero characters will unlock special skills the character has while in the
		field. Schematics and characters are generally assigned a rarity, which determines how much they can be leveled and evolved. A player's 
		inventory of schematics and characters is limited, but players can opt to slot anyone they do not need into a collection book to gain
		rewards when certain collection sets are completed; use one or more of these schematics or characters to transform them into a new random
		item, or simply retire them to gain back experience points and other resources to free up the inventory slots.
