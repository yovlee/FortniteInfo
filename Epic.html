		<p>Epic Games is an American video game and software development company based in Cary, North Carolina. . 
		The company was founded by Tim Sweeney as Potomac Computer Systems in 1991, originally located in his parents'
		house in Potomac, Maryland. Following his first commercial video game release, ZZT (1991), the company became 
		Epic MegaGames in early 1992, and brought on Mark Rein, who is the company's vice president to date. Moving their 
		headquarters to Cary in 1999, the studio's name was simplified to Epic Games. Epic Games develops the Unreal Engine,
		a commercially available game engine which also powers their internally developed video games, such as Fortnite and the
		Unreal, Gears of War and Infinity Blade series. In 2014, Unreal Engine was named the "most successful videogame engine" 
		by Guinness World Records. Epic Games owns video game developer Chair Entertainment and cloud-based software developer 
		Cloudgine, and operates eponymous sub-studios in Seattle, England, Berlin, Yokohama and Seoul. Key personnel at Epic Games
		include chief executive officer Tim Sweeney, lead programmer Steve Polge and art director Chris Perna. Tencent acquired a 
		48.4% outstanding stake, equating to 40% of total Epic, in the company in 2012, after Epic Games realized that the video game
		industry was heavily developing towards the games as a service model.c By July 2017, Fortnite was finally in a state for public
		play. Epic launched the title through a paid early access then, with a full free-to-play release expected in 2018. Following on
		the popularity of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, a battle royale game released earlier in 2017, Epic developed a variant of Fortnite
		called Fortnite Battle Royale, which was released in September 2017 as a free-to-play title across computer, console, and mobile 
		platforms. Fortnite Battle Royale quickly gained an audience, amassing over 125 million players by May 2018 with estimates of having
		earned over US$1 billion by July 2018 through microtransactions, including its battle pass system. Epic Games, which had been valued
		at around US$825 million at the time of Tencent's acquisition, was estimated to be worth US$4.5 billion in July 2018 due to Fortnite
		Battle Royale, and expected to surpass US$8.5 billion by the end of 2018 with projected growth of the game. Player count
		continued to expand when Epic broke new ground by convincing Sony to change its stance on cross-platform play allowing players
		on any device to compete with each other in Fortnite Battle Royale. Fortnite has drawn nearly 250 million players as of March 2019.
