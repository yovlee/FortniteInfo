		<p>The vault in Fortnite is where all the guns go to die. Sometimes they can come back, but most of them stay there forever.
		Those guns in the vault are not usable in the game. Things that have been removed from the game like landing locations are not 
		put in the vault because they are gone for good. The vault is something that Epic Games can take things out for modes or just to
		be in the regular game. There is even a mode called Classic, which have the guns from original Fortnite. Some guns that have been
		vaulted are the burst AR, heavy shotgun, tactical SMG, SMG, SMG (there's two), LMG, suppressed AR, double barrel, guided missiles,
		quad launcher, hunting rifle, bolt action, compact SMG, zapotron, dual pistils, crossbow, thermal scoped AR, and scoped revolver. 
		The reason Epic Games has the vault, is so people can wait and hope for the gun they were sad to see go come back into the game.
		Sometimes guns are in the vault forever, and sometimes they will be brought back in the game for a long or short amount of time.
		There was an event where people playing at that time could go to a certain landing location called Loot Lake, and go into it and 
		there would lay the vault. There, guns were hovering in different crystal podiums, and whichever one broke first would be put back 
		in the game. the drum gun was chosen.
