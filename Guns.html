		<p>All the guns in the game have different damage and damage per second. Sometimes the DPS will be lower or higher than the damage. The rarities (common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary) can be recognized as gray, green, blue, purple, and orange. Those determine how good the gun is and how much higher it's stats go. This chart is out of date, but it was the only one I could find.
